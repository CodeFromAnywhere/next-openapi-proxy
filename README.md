# Next Openapi Proxy

This repo can be used as a template. It makes a proxy for another API in a serverless environment. To use it:

- put `ORIGINAL_SERVER_URL=https://exampleapi.com` in `.env`
- put `openapi.json` in `/public`

Motivation: Be able to provide OpenAPI based tools, testing, and other benefits.
